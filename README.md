# CS150: Magic Squares

This is an activity to be done in pairs!

## TODOs:
  1.  Read data from the text file square.txt into a 2D array
  2.  Print the array to the screen
  3.  Print the array to the screen upside down
  4.  Print the array to the screen left to right
  5.  Check to see if the array is a Magic Square (rows and columns sum to 15)

## Example:

Suppose the original array is:

| 1  | 2 | 3 |
| --- | --- | --- |
| 4 | 5 | 6 | 
| 7 | 8 | 9 | 

then TODO 2. would look like:
<pre>
 1  2  3 
 4  5  6  
 7  8  9 
</pre>

and TODO 3. would look like:
<pre>
 7  8  9 
 4  5  6  
 1  2  3 
</pre>

and TODO 4. would look like:
<pre>
 3  2  1 
 6  5  4  
 9  8  7 
</pre>

and TODO 5. should look like

<pre>
The array is a magic square
</pre>
